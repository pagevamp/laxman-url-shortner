# URL Shortener Project - Database Design (ER Diagram)

## üìò Overview

This document describes the **Entity Relationship (ER) structure** for the URL Shortener project built with **PostgreSQL**.  
The database supports core functionalities such as:

- User authentication and email verification  
- URL shortening and management  
- Analytics tracking (hits, device info, etc.)  
- Notification system for user alerts (e.g., URL expiry)

## üß© Entities and Relationships

### 1. üßë‚Äçüíª users

| email | VARCHAR(255) | User‚Äôs email address (unique) |
| verifyToken | VARCHAR(255) | 
| password | VARCHAR(255) | Encrypted password |
| verifiedAt | BOOLEAN | Email verification status |
| createdAt | TIMESTAMP | Record creation date |
| updatedAt | TIMESTAMP | Record update date |

**Relations:**
- One user ‚Üí many `urls`
- One user ‚Üí many `notifications`
- One user ‚Üí many `email_verifications`

---

### 2. ‚úâÔ∏è email_verifications
Stores email verification tokens for user account confirmation.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---------|------|--------------|
| id | SERIAL (PK) | Unique record ID |
| userId | INT (FK) | Linked user |

| isUsed | BOOLEAN | Whether the token has been used |
| createdAt | TIMESTAMP | Token creation time |
| expiresAt | TIMESTAMP | Token expiration time |
| verifiedAt | TIMESTAMP | Time when the user verified their email |

**Relations:**
- Many tokens ‚Üí belong to one user (`users.id < email_verifications.userId`)

---

### 3. üîó urls

| clickCount | INT | Number of times the URL has been accessed |
| notifiedAt | TIMESTAMP | Time when owner was notified of expiry |
| createdAt | TIMESTAMP | Record creation date |
| updatedAt | TIMESTAMP | Record update date |

**Relations:**
- One user ‚Üí many URLs (`users.id < urls.userId`)
- One URL ‚Üí many hits (`urls.id < hits.urlId`)
- One URL ‚Üí many notifications (`urls.id < notifications.urlId`)

---

### 4. üìä hits
Stores analytics for every time a short URL is accessed.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---------|------|--------------|
| id | SERIAL (PK) | Unique record ID |
| urlId | INT (FK) | Associated URL |
| accessedAt | TIMESTAMP | Access time |
| ip | VARCHAR(100) | Visitor‚Äôs IP address |
| country | VARCHAR(10) | Parsed country code |
| userAgent | TEXT | Full user-agent string |
| browser | VARCHAR(50) | Extracted browser name |
| os | VARCHAR(50) | Extracted operating system |
| device | VARCHAR(50) | Extracted device type |
| referrer | TEXT | Referring source (if any) |

**Relations:**
- Many hits ‚Üí belong to one URL (`urls.id < hits.urlId`)

---

### 5. üîî notifications
Stores messages and alerts sent to users (e.g., when URLs expire).

| Column | Type | Description |
|---------|------|--------------|
| id | SERIAL (PK) | Unique record ID |
| userId | INT (FK) | Linked user |
| urlId | INT (FK) | Related URL (optional) |
| type | VARCHAR(50) | Notification type (e.g., ‚Äúexpiry‚Äù, ‚Äúreminder‚Äù) |
| message | VARCHAR | Message content |
| is_sent | BOOLEAN | Whether notification has been sent |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | When the notification was created |
| sent_at | TIMESTAMP | When it was actually sent |

**Relations:**
- One user ‚Üí many notifications (`users.id < notifications.userId`)
- One URL ‚Üí many notifications (`urls.id < notifications.urlId`)

---

## üîó Relationship Summary

| Relationship | Description |
|---------------|--------------|
| users ‚Üí urls | A user can create multiple URLs |
| users ‚Üí email_verifications | A user can have multiple email verification tokens |
| urls ‚Üí hits | A shortened URL can be accessed multiple times |
| urls ‚Üí notifications | A URL can have multiple related notifications |
| users ‚Üí notifications | A user can receive many notifications |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Notes

- **Email verification** is managed via the `email_verifications` table (supports multiple tokens and expiry handling).  
- **Rate limiting** and other logic (like URL redirection and expiry) are handled in application middleware.  
- **Notifications** track expiry alerts and future system notifications.  
- **Analytics** from the `hits` table allow detailed reporting (browser, OS, device, referrer, etc.).
